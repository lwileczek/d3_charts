# D3 Charts

D3 is a popular JavaScript library that enables data bindings with elements on
the page, easy DOM selections, and chart building. To help learn how to use D3,
I've made a few charts to get a handle on using SVGs as building blocks, using
Enter, Update, Remove which is a major theme in D3.  

To see charts, start a local host server in this root of the directory, and then
navigate to each folder and open the `html` file. 

```sh
$ python3 -m http.server
```

Then go to your web browser and put the following URL in:
`http://localhost:8000/`
